# Clean Code and Scalability

This document outlines the clean code practices and scalability considerations implemented in the Toro AI Assistant project.

## Clean Code Principles

The Toro AI Assistant codebase follows several key clean code principles:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each module, class, and function has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **Lambda Functions**: Each Lambda has a clear purpose (ingest, process, notify)
- **Adapters**: Handle external service interactions (e.g., `DynamoDBClient`, `BedrockClient`)
- **Models**: Define data structures and validation rules (e.g., `QuestionRequest`, `QuestionItem`)
- **Factories**: Responsible for creating and configuring clients (e.g., `get_dynamodb_client`)

Example of SRP in the codebase:

```python
# DynamoDBClient has a single responsibility: manage database operations
class DynamoDBClient:
    def save_question(self, user_id: str, question_text: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Saves a new question in DynamoDB."""
        # Implementation details...

# BedrockClient has a single responsibility: interface with AWS Bedrock
class BedrockClient:
    def retrieve_and_generate(self, query: str, max_tokens: int = DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Retrieves relevant documents and generates a response based on them."""
        # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Dependency Injection

The codebase uses dependency injection to improve testability and reduce coupling:

- **Lambda Handlers**: Accept client dependencies as parameters
- **Clients**: Accept resource dependencies during initialization

Example of dependency injection:

```python
def lambda_handler(
    event: dict,
    context: LambdaContext,
    db_client: Optional[DynamoDBClient] = None,
    process_topic: Optional[SNSTopic] = None,
) -> dict:
    """Main Lambda handler with injected dependencies."""
    db_client = db_client or get_dynamodb_client()
    process_topic = process_topic or get_process_topic()
    # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Pragmatic Code Organization

The project organizes code with a feature-first approach, separating shared components into a common library:

- **Feature Directories**: Lambda functions organized by domain (questions, websocket)
- **Shared Library**: Common code in a central location for reuse
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Utilities for logging, validation, and configuration

Current project structure:
```
lib/                   # Shared libraries
  adapters/            # External service clients (DynamoDB, Bedrock)
  models/              # Data models and validation
  core/                # Utilities and constants
  factories/           # Client creation
```

### 4. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Common functionality is extracted to avoid duplication:

- **Shared Libraries**: Central location for reused code
- **Utils**: Helper functions for common tasks
- **Constants**: Centralized configuration values

Example of DRY principle application:

```python
# core/response_utils.py - Centralized response formatting
def format_api_gateway_response(body: dict, status_code: int = 200) -> dict:
    """Formats response for API Gateway."""
    return {
        "statusCode": status_code,
        "headers": {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        "body": json.dumps(body),
    }
```

### 5. Input Validation and Error Handling

The codebase uses robust validation and structured error handling:

- **Pydantic Models**: For schema validation and type checking
- **Try/Except Blocks**: With specific exception handling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of errors and operations

Example of validation with Pydantic:

```python
class QuestionRequest(BaseModel):
    """Model for validating question requests."""
    user_id: str
    question: str

    @field_validator("user_id", "question")
    @classmethod
    def not_empty(cls, v: str) -> str:
        """Validates that string fields are not empty."""
        if not v or not v.strip():
            raise ValueError("Cannot be an empty string")
        return v.strip()
```

### 6. Meaningful Names

The codebase uses descriptive, intention-revealing names:

- **Function Names**: Describe what they do (e.g., `save_question`, `retrieve_and_generate`)
- **Variable Names**: Indicate their purpose (e.g., `user_id`, `question_text`)
- **Class Names**: Represent their role (e.g., `DynamoDBClient`, `QuestionResponse`)

### 7. Unit Testing

The project implements comprehensive unit tests:

- **Test Coverage**: Tests for critical components
- **Test Isolation**: Through mocking and dependency injection
- **Parameterized Tests**: For testing multiple scenarios

## Scalability Considerations

The Toro AI Assistant is designed with scalability in mind through several key architectural decisions:

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture

The use of SNS topics to decouple components:

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Prevents blocking operations
- **Independent Scaling**: Each Lambda function scales independently
- **Buffering**: SNS handles traffic spikes

### 2. Serverless Architecture

AWS Lambda's serverless model provides:

- **Auto-scaling**: Functions scale automatically with demand
- **No Idle Resources**: Pay only for what you use
- **Concurrent Executions**: Multiple instances run in parallel

### 3. Database Design

DynamoDB design choices for scalability:

- **Partition Strategy**: User-based partitioning for even distribution
- **Sort Keys**: Efficient retrieval of related items
- **On-demand Capacity**: Auto-scaling for unpredictable workloads

### 4. Caching Strategies

The system implements caching at multiple levels:

- **AI Responses**: Common questions could be cached
- **Database Reads**: Frequent queries could be cached
- **API Gateway**: Response caching for repeated requests

### 5. Stateless Design

Lambda functions are designed to be stateless:

- **No Session State**: All state is stored in DynamoDB
- **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to retry after failures
- **Independent Execution**: No shared mutable state

## Future Scalability Enhancements

Potential improvements for even greater scalability:

### 1. Observability and Monitoring

- **CloudWatch Alarms**: For proactive monitoring
- **X-Ray Tracing**: For distributed tracing across components
- **Custom Metrics**: For application-specific monitoring

### 2. Additional Caching Layers

- **ElastiCache**: For frequently accessed data
- **CloudFront**: For frontend assets and API responses
- **DAX**: For DynamoDB acceleration

### 3. Performance Optimizations

- **Lambda Concurrency Configuration**: Set reserved concurrency for critical functions
- **Payload Size Optimization**: Minimize data transferred between components
- **Cold Start Mitigation**: Strategies to minimize Lambda cold starts

### 4. Advanced RAG Techniques

- **Chunking Strategies**: Optimizing document segmentation
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combining different retrieval methods
- **Feedback Loops**: Improving retrieval based on user feedback

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Automate build, test, and deployment
  ```yaml
  # Example workflow file (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  name: Deploy Toro AI Assistant
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main]

    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `AWS_REGION`
- **Deployment Strategies**:
  - Canary deployments
  - Blue/green deployments
  - Automated rollbacks on failure

### 6. Enhanced Security Implementation

- **IAM Roles with Least Privilege**: Fine-grained permissions for each Lambda function
- **API Gateway Authorization**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
  - API keys for simple use cases
  - AWS Cognito for user authentication
  - Custom authorizers for complex scenarios
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Set up detailed logging and alerting
  - Log analysis for security events
  - Anomaly detection
  - Security incident alerting
- **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
  - DynamoDB encryption
  - S3 server-side encryption
  - HTTPS for all API endpoints
- **VPC Integration**: Consider placing resources in a VPC for network isolation

### 7. Improved Architectural Layering

Refactoring the code to better implement a clean, layered architecture:

- **API Layer**: Strictly for HTTP request/response formatting
  - Request/response models
  - API-specific validation
  - Endpoint configuration

- **Service Layer**: Pure business logic without infrastructure details
  - Application services for orchestration
  - Domain services for business rules
  - Use cases for specific features

- **Data Layer**: Persistence operations abstracted from services
  - Repositories for data access patterns
  - Domain entity mapping
  - Query optimization

- **Infrastructure Layer**: External system integration
  - AWS service clients
  - Third-party integrations
  - Configuration management

Target directory structure:
```
src/
  api/                # API Layer
    handlers/         # Lambda entry points
    models/           # Request/response models
    validation/       # Input validation

  core/               # Service Layer
    services/         # Business logic services
    usecases/         # Application use cases
    entities/         # Domain entities

  data/               # Data Layer
    repositories/     # Data access patterns
    mappers/          # Entity-DB mapping

  infrastructure/     # Infrastructure Layer
    adapters/         # External service adapters
    config/           # Configuration
```

Benefits:
- Improved testability through proper dependency inversion
- Better separation of concerns with clear boundaries
- Easier to maintain and extend the codebase
- More straightforward onboarding for new developers

## Clean Code Best Practices

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code for this project, check for:

1. **Function Size**: Functions should be small and focused
2. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Keep complexity low
3. **Error Handling**: Proper try/except blocks with recovery
4. **Documentation**: Clear docstrings and comments
5. **Testing**: Adequate test coverage

### Code Style and Formatting

The project uses:

- **Ruff**: For linting and formatting

- **Type Hints**: Throughout the codebase
- **Docstrings**: Google-style docstrings

Example of properly formatted and documented code:

```python
def update_question_status(
    self, user_id: str, question_id: str, status: str
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Updates only the status of a question in DynamoDB.

    Args:
        user_id: User ID
        question_id: Question ID
        status: New status (pending, processing, completed, error)

    Returns:
        Dict with update result
    """
